# AI-Project

•	Implemented graph search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and A-star algorithms and heuristics

•	Implemented Pac-Man agents using machine learning, A* search, alpha-beta minimax, and expectimax techniques.

•	Programmed reinforcement learning algorithms such as value iteration and Q-learning.

•	Implemented the perceptron algorithm and gradient descent, which were used to train neural network classifiers. Trained a convolutional neural network to learn better features on a set of scanned handwritten digit images.
